# My Math Journey

My mathematical journey began in high school through a gifted program. As a current college student, I'm exploring various subjects, but my love for math remains unshaken.

I enjoy watching math-related videos and reading articles from [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile) - one of my favorite content pieces is '[Problems with Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRRolKTlF6Q&t=407s).'

This repository is where I share my math passion and plan to keep exploring my mathematical interests.
