# My Mathematical Journey

I've always had a passion for math, which was ignited during my high school years in a gifted math program. I found the stories behind mathematical concepts like the Mandelbrot Set and constants like e and Ï€ truly fascinating.

As a college student, I've had to focus on a variety of subjects, but my love for mathematics remains strong. In my free time, I enjoy watching math-related videos and reading articles, such as those from [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile), which delve into mathematical problems and proofs.

One of my favorite Numberphile videos is "[Problems with Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRRolKTlF6Q&t=407s)," which illustrates the beauty of mathematical problem-solving.

I've created this repository to share my passion for math and connect with others who share the same enthusiasm. It's a space where I can discuss my experiences, explore mathematical topics, and simply enjoy the world of math.

My journey with math continues, and I'm excited to see where it leads.
